# Fixing Chrome Browser Slowness

This repo documents my step-by-step process for diagnosing and fixing performance issues in Google Chrome on my system.

---

## Background
- Issue: Chrome started running slow (e.g. laggy scrolling, tabs freezing).
- System: Windowns 11 Home 64-bit, HP 255 G8 Notebook PC, and Chrome version Version 137.0.7151.41 (Up to date)
- Goal: Identify root cause and apply fixes.

---
## Before applying the following fixes, I uninstalled and reinstalled Google Chrome to eliminate any corruption,
bad extensions, or misconfigurations that might have been causing slowness. This ensured that all following tests were 
done on a clean installation.

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Baseline Performance Check
- Task Manager / System Monitor
- Even with 5 tabs open, system resource usage stays comfortably under recommended limits.
- Extensions loaded

### 2. Disable Extensions
- Disabled all, re-enabled one by one
  - Application Launcher For Drive (by Google)
  - Google Docs Offline

### 3. Clear Cache & Data
cleared up unnecessary cache, cookies and history

### 4. Chrome Flags (Skipped)
- Decided to skip adjusting experimental flags for now, as performance had already improved post-reinstallation.
- Will revisit if issues return.

### 5. Check for background processes
  - cleared up unnecessary cache, cookies and history

### 6. Malware Scan
- Ran a full system scan using **Windows Security**.
- No threats were detected.

## Conclusion

After performing the above steps, it became clear that the most effective solution was: Uninstalling and reinstalling Chrome.
  - This resolved the lag, freezing, and sluggish performance. The clean reinstall likely removed corrupted files, misconfigured
    settings, or hidden issues related to extensions. Chrome now runs smoothly under normal use conditions.
